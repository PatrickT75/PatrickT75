### Hi there!

I'm Patrick Kurnia. I am passionate about all things health and wellbeing. As we approach newer and higher territories in human health, we need  lots of data at every step: to understand the mechanisms of disease, predict how noncommunicable diseases will grow over time, and evaluate the efficacy of our dietary and pharmacological interventions. I am interested in how we can take advantage of this data to get new insights and bring healthcare both forward and around to the world.

I studied nutrition at the Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, as well as biochemistry and computational biology at UCLA. I was part of the Rai Lab at Columbia University Medical Center, where we study protein biomarkers of many common and rare cancers. I'm currently working on a web-based application to streamline proteomics analysis so that researchers can go from raw data to candidate biomarkers in no time.

Before this, I was part of the Pellegrini Lab at UCLA where we use machine learning to predict the age acceleration of dogs and humans. We used epigenomics data to create our age predictions. I also worked at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition where we analyzed the microbiome of patients enrolled in intervention trials, as well as the metabolomics of kombucha.

In my spare time, I love to do sports (badminton in particular), cook foods from all around the world, and play music ([check out my covers here](https://www.youtube.com/@patrickkurnia8190)). Mental health is just as important!

You can also see my [writings](https://kurniapatrick.wordpress.com/) here on food, science and anything in between.
