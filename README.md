### Hi there!

I'm Patrick Kurnia. I am passionate about all things health. As we approach newer and higher territories in human health, we need  lots of data at every step: to understand the mechanisms of disease, predict how noncommunicable diseases will grow over time, and evaluate the efficacy of our dietary and pharmacological interventions. I am interested in how we can take advantage of this data to get new insights and bring healthcare both forward and around to the world.

I have primarily been involved in research at the academic setting as part of several organizations: the Breast Oncology Center at Dana-Farber, Columbia University Medical Center, Pellegrini Lab at UCLA, and Center for Human Nutrition at UCLA.

In my spare time, I love to do sports (badminton in particular), cook foods from all around the world, and play music ([check out my covers here](https://www.youtube.com/@patrickkurnia8190)).

You can also see my [writings](https://kurniapatrick.wordpress.com/) here on food, science and anything in between.
